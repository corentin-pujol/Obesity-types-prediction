## Project - Obesity Levels Prediction

### PUJOL Corentin - PELET Quentin


## Content :

- Dataset of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition in individuals from Colombia, Peru and Mexico.
- Jupyter Notebook for the analysis of obesity levels with Machine Learning models to predict the BMI range of a person. Flask API included at the end of the notebook.
- PowerPoint Presentation of the project.
- The different html files for the display of the API.
- Static folder containing the style.css, which allow the design of the html pages.
- The different models trained on the dataset.

## Description

The objectif of this project was to analyse an assigned dataset.
Our dataset presents the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.

The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level). 
77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

## Required libraries

Pandas - Matplotlib - Seaborn - Numpy - Sklearn - Pickle - Falsk - Flask_ngrok

## How to use the API

In the Colab notebook, before executing the code, the files must be placed in the Colab directory following the same organization as in the GitHub directory, in order to avoid any problems when executing the code (statics files in the static folder, pkl models in the models folder, etc).

You must run all the code in order to use the API (although it takes a few minutes).

Once the API part of the code is running, click on the link ending by .ngrok.io

It may happen that a "The website you are about to open is misleading" page opens when the Flask application is run, so you should still proceed to open it:

- details

- visit this dangerous site

- If you click on reload page, the home screen will appear as follows:
